The idea of the game is from blosics 2, but the blosics 2 is created in flash. I want to make it in javascript.

In the code, the physical engine is box2d, which is already widely used in gaming development, such angry bird. 

The game is about hurling balls at blocks to satisfy your primitive urge for destruction.

You can find blosics 2 in here: http://jayisgames.com/games/blosics-2/

This game is created for fun.
